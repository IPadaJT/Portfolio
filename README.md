# Portfolio
A repository to hold all my projects that I'm would like to showcase to future employers/mentors :)

# VG Sales
A project looking to analyze changes within the video game industry over a 30+ year period. Insights were derived over the top-best sellers within the gaming industry, changes in user opinion about video games, and changes in critic opinion over games in that time period.
I used Python and pandas to explore and clean the data source of duplicates, nulls, etc. I used SQL to create the tables and imported my clean data into a database. In addition, SQL was used to query the data to extract insights about trends within video game sales and the industry. 
Data Vizualization was done using MS Excel. 

# Music Insights
A project looking to extract actionable insights to drive business strategy and growth using data from a music store database. 
A current WIP but Python was used to automate reading csv files into pandas DataFrames. While pandas is being used to evaluate the data and clean the data as necessary prior to being put into a postgreSQL database. SQL was used to create tables and will be used to query the data to answer questions and discover trends that will help drive business strategy for the music store.
